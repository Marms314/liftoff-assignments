## Submission Instructions

### Overview
An app that enables studying through flash cards and quizzes made by admin users. User quiz scores and flashcard use is tracked to allow progress to be seen easily. Admins can also set goals for users and receive notifications when that goal is met. This allows the admin user to authorize prizes/incentives to be given to the user to reward their continued learning.

This app is inspired by call centers with very complicated and/or technical natures where learning can stagnate after an employee leaves training. The app is meant to encourage an employee to stay enganged and learn new concepts on their own as both the employee and the company will benefit from their increased knowledge.
